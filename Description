The goal of this project is to find the best ways to choose crops so that farmers can get higher returns. To make accurate crop suggestions, the problem requires looking at a lot
of complicated facts about the soil and environment. For smart crop choice, the method includes working with a set of factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and soil nutrients (K, N,
P, and pH). Machine learning models like Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and SVM are used. These models were chosen because they can handle a wide range of
data and make accurate predictions. The success of the solution is measured by how well it suggests crops. The point of this paper is to show how crop selection methods can be used to help
farmers and agriculture solve a number of problems. This raises the rate of crop production yield and is good for the economyâ€™s different land situations. So, a system of rankings is used to figure
out how good the crops are. This process also tells you the rate of both good and bad crops.
